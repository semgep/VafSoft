      Dr. Sergei Gepshtein is a scientist working in the areas of perceptual
      psychology, systems neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. His
      research interests include perception of visual depth and movement,
      perceptual organization, interaction of vision with other senses, planning
      of multistep actions, perception of high-dimensional visual pasterns, such
      as faces, dynamics of cortical neural networks, their modeling and
      simulation.
      <br /><br />
      For the last 17 years he has been a member of the Center for the
      Neurobiology of Vision at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La
      Jolla, California, where he studies perception and active behavior from
      the mechanistic perspective of neuroscience and from a perspective that
      respects experience as a self-contained area of research.
      <br /><br />
      He directs studies of Adaptive Sensory Technologies at the Salk Institute
      with the goal to translate results of basic science for applications
      ranging from immersive visual technologies and adaptive sighting devices
      to urban design and forensic science. Recently, he joined the faculty of
      the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where he directs the
      Center for Spatial Perception & Concrete Experience: a platform for
      investigating spatial experience as a natural narrative process.
      <br /><br />
      His work has been supported by grants and awards from the National Eye
      Institute, the National Institute on Aging, the National Science
      Foundation, the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind, the Swartz Foundation
      for Theoretical Neuroscience, and the National Institutes of Natural
      Sciences of Japan.
      <br /><br />
      On the applied and translational sides of scientific work, he is
      increasingly interested in studies of the built environment and design of
      immersive media: as a founding member of the World Building Institute, as
      the inaugural recipient of the Harold Hay Research Award from the Academy
      of Neuroscience for Architecture (ANFA) and as a member of the Freeman
      Design Leadership Council (now Emeritus). In 2016 he joined the Board of
      Directors of ANFA, to further the growing understanding of human response
      to the built environment. In 2026 he will serve as the President of ANFA.
      <br /><br />
      In teaching and education, he has developed a curriculum that integrates
      diverse concepts of space from the disciplines of science and design,
      using it to teach undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of
      Southern California in Los Angeles, the New School of Architecture and
      Design in San Diego, and the University of California San Diego. Dr.
